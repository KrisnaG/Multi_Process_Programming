# Multi_Process_and_Threaded_Programming

Uutilising multi-process and multi-threaded programming to complete a task/problem.

These programs will use system calls which run on Linux systems.

### Practice Functions
* print_n_numbers(n)
* sum_int_array(array)

### Parallel Search
Simple program that demonstrates the use of the openSSL library functions to brute-force search for an AES encryption key given a partial key. <br>
The brute-force search is conducted with parallel processes arranged in a "ring-of-processes" topology.

### Nordvik_Problem
The road to Nordvik carries traffic (cars and trucks) in both directions, except at a 1 lane suspension bridge. <br> 
The bridge is only wide enough to carry traffic in one direction at a time. Only one truck is allowed on the bridge at anytime. <br>
This program uses threads to act as vehicles (cars and trucks), that crosses the Nordvik bridge which acts as a shared resource.
